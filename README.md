# TRAVOX
 🤖 An AI simulation of transport vehicles


### TRAVOX
**Travox** is an artificial intelligence (AI) that is emulated in the **Unity Game Engine** using the programming language **C#**. **It is an FSD**, or Fully-self-driving AI, that is *simulated using depth sensors and other object detecting modules.* **Its primary goal is to simulate What if... scenarios with minimal human resources**. It allows you to examine how A.I. can be trained, how it reacts to different circumstances in real time, and how it performs real-time computations. It is **heavily influenced by Tesla's artificial intelligence** in their self-driving electric vehicles.
