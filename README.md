# TRAVOX
 🤖 An AI simulation of transport vehicles


### TRAVOX
**Travox** is an artificial intelligence (AI) that is emulated in the **Unity Game Engine** using the programming language **C#**. **It is an FSD**, or Fully-self-driving AI, that is *simulated using depth sensors and other object detecting modules.* **Its primary goal is to simulate What if... scenarios with minimal human resources**. It allows you to examine how A.I. can be trained, how it reacts to different circumstances in real time, and how it performs real-time computations. It is **heavily influenced by Tesla's artificial intelligence** in their self-driving electric vehicles.


## Motivation
I wanted to create a replica of the Tesla smart AI in Unity game engine to get an insight of how much work goes into creating or replicating this type of AI and also how does it work and function
